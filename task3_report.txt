The waiting time for a new truck to arrive was implemented by adding a delay on the truck function that handles the replacement
of the trucks, which has a random integer value between 1 and 10 seconds.

The behavior of having a conveyor stop while a truck is being replaced was implemented by adding a the process id to the "package"
tuple that the conveyor process sends to the truck process that identifies the conveyor process so that, when the truck needs to been
replaced, the truck process can send a unique message (a "wait" atom) to the conveyor process to signal its replacement to
the conveyor. This new message has been added as one of the patterns that the conveyor can evaluate, that makes the process move to
a new conveyor function that waits to receive a "go" atom, sent by the truck process when the new truck arrives,
in order to return to the main function to continue to send packages to the truck.
